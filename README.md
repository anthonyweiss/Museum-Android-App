# Museum-Android-App
Android Studio app using Java. This app consists of a Main Activity which displays 4 museums (currently) in the NJ/NYC area, allowing the user to choose a museum to be taken to a 2nd Activity which shows ticket pricing for Adults, Seniors, and Students, as well as seeing how much a combination of those tickets would total up to (including sales tax). The user can also click on the image in the 2nd activity to be taken to the corresponding museum's website.
Created using API Level 30: Android 10.0+ (R), with Pixel 3 XL API 29/30 (either work).

Below is the Main Activity, or the first/primary screen you see when opening the app. From here you can select any of the 4 shown museums by tapping on the images to take you to the next activity.

Below is the Second Activity, which shows the pricing of the selected museum's tickets, as well as 3 input boxes for users to enter how many adult, senior, and student tickets they want/need. Users may also tap the image to continue to the museum's official website.
In this example, I just happened to choose the Museum of Modern Art, but this will update with whichever museum the user chooses.
